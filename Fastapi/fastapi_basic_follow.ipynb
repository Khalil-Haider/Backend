    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are starting our journey into **FastAPI**.\n",
    "FastAPI is a **modern, fast (high-performance) web framework** for building APIs with Python, based on **standard Python type hints**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into FastAPI, let’s understand **what an API actually is**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ What is an API? (The Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "When building software, we often need **different components** (e.g., frontend, backend, database, mobile apps) to **communicate with each other**.\n",
    "But how do they talk in a structured way? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "without api we also communicate but here we adopt monolithic architecture whih is very bad becasue in any single flop crash whole website thats why it is not good so \n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **APIs** come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Definition (The Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a mechanism that enables **two software components** (such as the frontend and backend of an application) to **communicate with each other** using a defined set of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rules**\n",
    "* **Protocols**\n",
    "* **Data formats**\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler words:\n",
    "👉 An API is like a **messenger** that carries requests from one part of the system to another and delivers responses back.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Example Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **mobile app (frontend)** wants to fetch user profile data.\n",
    "* It sends an **API request** to the **backend server**.\n",
    "* The backend processes the request, gets the data from the database, and sends an **API response** back to the frontend.\n",
    "* The frontend shows the data to the user.\n"

    "# 🌟 Key Features of FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ Core Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fast** 🚀: Very high performance, on par with **NodeJS** and **Go** (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.\n",
    "* **Fast to Code** ⌨️: Increases development speed by about **200% to 300%**.\n",
    "* **Fewer Bugs** 🐞: Reduces about **40% of developer-induced errors** due to built-in validation and typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Input Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Built on top of **Pydantic**, FastAPI automatically validates request data (query params, body, headers, cookies).\n",
    "   * Reduces boilerplate code and prevents invalid inputs from reaching your logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Auto-Generated Interactive Documentation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * FastAPI automatically generates **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc** docs.\n",
    "   * Developers and testers can try out endpoints directly from the browser without writing extra documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seamless Integration with Modern Ecosystem**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Works smoothly with **Machine Learning & Deep Learning libraries** (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).\n",
    "   * Built-in support for **OAuth2, JWT authentication, SQLAlchemy, async ORMs**.\n",
    "   * Easy deployment with **Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud providers**.\n",

    "# ⚖️ Why Choose FastAPI Instead of Flask?\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, developers used **Flask** to build APIs.\n",
    "But as applications grew more **complex, high-traffic, and real-time**, Flask’s **older technology stack** began showing limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ The Solution: FastAPI Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI solves these limitations with **modern design and technology**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ASGI vs WSGI**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Flask uses **WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)** → can only handle **synchronous requests** (one at a time per worker).\n",
    "   * FastAPI uses **ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)** → can handle **concurrent requests**, ideal for modern real-time apps (chat systems, IoT, async DB queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **⚡ Fast (Performance on par with NodeJS & Go)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Thanks to **Starlette** (for web layer) and **Pydantic** (for validation), FastAPI is **one of the fastest Python frameworks available**.\n",
    "   * Performance is **comparable to NodeJS and Go**, far ahead of Flask in benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rust-Powered Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Pydantic**, which powers request/response validation, uses **Rust under the hood** → blazing fast JSON/data validation.\n",
    "   * Flask needs manual checks or extra libraries, which are slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Type Hints = Auto Validation + Docs**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * FastAPI relies on **Python type hints** to generate:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Automatic **request validation**\n",
    "     * Automatic **interactive Swagger & ReDoc documentation**\n",
    "   * Flask requires **extra libraries** (like Marshmallow) and manual documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Web Servers (Gunicorn vs Uvicorn)**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Flask typically runs on **Gunicorn + WSGI** stack.\n",
    "   * FastAPI typically runs on **Uvicorn + ASGI** stack.\n",
    "   * **Gunicorn (Green Unicorn)**: traditional WSGI HTTP server, great for sync apps but not built for async.\n",
    "   * **Uvicorn (Unicorn)**: lightning-fast ASGI web server built on **uvloop** and **httptools** (written in C), designed for async and high concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Web Server Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Gunicorn (for Flask)\n",
    "\n",
    "* WSGI-based (sync only).\n",
    "* Battle-tested for years.\n",
    "* Relies on multiple workers to scale (CPU-bound).\n",
    "* Simpler, but not suited for modern async workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Uvicorn (for FastAPI)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ASGI-based (async-ready).\n",
    "* Uses **uvloop** (fast event loop in C) → performance boost.\n",
    "* Uses **httptools** (C-based HTTP parser) → very efficient.\n",
    "* Built for **high concurrency and real-time communication** (WebSockets, streaming).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Summary**:\n",
    "We choose **FastAPI over Flask** because it’s:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **⚡ Faster** (NodeJS/Go-level speed).\n",
    "* **🌀 Async-ready (ASGI + Uvicorn)**.\n",
    "* **🦀 Rust-powered validation** (via Pydantic).\n",
    "* **📘 Type-hint driven auto-docs & validation**.\n",
    "* **👨‍💻 Developer-friendly** with modern features.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 That makes FastAPI + Uvicorn the best choice for **modern, high-performance APIs**.\n",

    "# 🛠⚡ HTTP Status Codes & HTTPException in FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Every API request needs a clear **signal**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Success (e.g., 200, 201)\n",
    "* ❌ Error (e.g., 400, 404, 500)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of crashing the server, FastAPI lets you send **graceful error responses** using `HTTPException`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 What\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`status_code`** → tells FastAPI which HTTP code to send back.\n",
    "* **`HTTPException`** → raise this when something goes wrong, with:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * a status code (`404`, `400`, etc.)\n",
    "  * a message (`detail=\"Not found\"`)\n",
    "  * optional headers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠 How (Examples)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Normal success with status code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, status\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/items/\", status_code=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)\n",
    "async def create_item(name: str):\n",
    "    return {\"name\": name}   # returns 201 Created\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Error handling with HTTPException\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\n",
    "async def read_item(item_id: int):\n",
    "    if item_id == 0:\n",
    "        # Raise error if item not found\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(\n",
    "            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,\n",
    "            detail=\"Item not found\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "    return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ **Core Message:**\n",
    "Use **`status_code`** for successful responses, and **`HTTPException`** for clean, controlled error responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use **201 Created** for POST requests that add resources.\n",
    "* Use **204 No Content** when nothing needs to be returned.\n",
    "* Use **400-series codes** to clearly communicate client-side mistakes.\n",
    "* Use **500-series codes** sparingly—these should represent true server failures, not client issues.\n",
    "* Always prefer **status constants** from `fastapi.status` (like `status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND`) for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "⚡ **Pro Starter Statement (Course Tip):**\n",
    "*\"Think of HTTP status codes as the **body language** of your API. Even before looking at the actual response, a client can tell whether the request worked, failed, or needs another action—just from the status code.\"*\n",
